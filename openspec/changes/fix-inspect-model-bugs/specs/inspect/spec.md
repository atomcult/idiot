# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Extracting snapd's state
With `--extract-state [<file>]` (or `--extract-state=<file>`), given
before the image, `idiot inspect image` SHALL also copy the image's snapd
`state.json` to `<file>`, or to `./state.json` when no file is given, and
say where it was saved. The argument after `--extract-state` SHALL be taken
as the file only when another argument follows it. `--extract-state=` with
no file SHALL fail before inspecting. When the image has no readable snapd
state (never booted, or its ubuntu-data encrypted), the command SHALL print
the summary and then fail saying no state could be saved. Options SHALL
come before the image; an option after it SHALL fail with the usage
message.

#### Scenario: Save the state
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot inspect image --extract-state st.json booted.img` on a booted image
- **THEN** `st.json` holds the image's snapd state as valid JSON and the command exits zero

#### Scenario: Option after the image
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot inspect image booted.img --extract-state`
- **THEN** the command fails with `usage: idiot inspect image [options] <disk.img>`

#### Scenario: Default file
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot inspect image --extract-state booted.img` on a booted image
- **THEN** the state is saved to `./state.json`

#### Scenario: Empty file name
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot inspect image --extract-state= booted.img`
- **THEN** the command fails saying `--extract-state=` needs a file name, before inspecting

#### Scenario: No state in the image
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot inspect image --extract-state st.json fresh.img` on an image that has never booted
- **THEN** the summary is printed, then the command fails saying the image has no snapd state to save, and `st.json` isn't created
