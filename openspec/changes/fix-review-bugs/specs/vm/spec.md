# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Booting Ubuntu Core and other disk images under QEMU from `idiot vm`, with
optional UEFI secure boot and an emulated TPM, for any supported target
architecture.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CPU model for the target architecture
When the target architecture matches the host and `/dev/kvm` exists,
`idiot vm` SHALL use KVM with the host CPU. Otherwise it SHALL emulate the
most capable CPU model QEMU offers for that architecture, so that 64-bit
guests boot under emulation.

#### Scenario: arm64 image on an amd64 host
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot vm --arch arm64 core-arm64.img` on an amd64 host
- **THEN** QEMU emulates a 64-bit arm64 CPU and the image's firmware starts

#### Scenario: Native with KVM
- **WHEN** the target matches the host and `/dev/kvm` exists
- **THEN** the VM runs with KVM acceleration and the host CPU model

### Requirement: Firmware selection
With secure boot (the default) `idiot vm` SHALL boot the architecture's
secure-boot UEFI firmware with Microsoft keys enrolled. With `--no-sb` it
SHALL boot the architecture's UEFI firmware without secure boot on amd64,
arm64, armhf and riscv64. If the needed firmware is not installed it SHALL
fail naming the package that provides it.

#### Scenario: No secure boot on arm64
- **WHEN** the user runs `idiot vm --arch arm64 --no-sb image.img`
- **THEN** the VM boots non-secure-boot UEFI firmware

#### Scenario: Firmware missing
- **WHEN** the arm64 firmware package is not installed
- **THEN** the command fails naming `qemu-efi-aarch64`

### Requirement: Emulated TPM lifetime
With `--tpm`, the emulated TPM SHALL run only for the lifetime of the VM: it
SHALL be stopped when QEMU exits, however QEMU exits.

#### Scenario: VM shut down
- **WHEN** a VM started with `--tpm` exits
- **THEN** no swtpm process for that VM remains
